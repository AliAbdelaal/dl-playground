in this repo i post random experiments that i do in a course or for curiosity !

## [IMDB sentiment analysis with ANN](IMDB_In_Keras.ipynb)

in this notebook we investigate a sentiment analysis using an artificial neural network built with keras, we lose of course an important part of the information as the model assume no structure in the data but as a starting point it's good.

## [image classification with MLP on MNIST dataset](MLP_for_images.ipynb)

in this notebook we see how MLP or (ANN) can't do well on images, as the parameters of the network grow exponentially, and the network assume no structure to the data itself.
